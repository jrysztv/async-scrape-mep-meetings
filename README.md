# mep-meetings
A lightweight, simple scraper to collect meeting data of a given MEP politician in a Streamlit wrapper.

In this project, I demonstrate the ability to program async-logic with class inheritance, deployed in Streamlit.
This project was a favour to a friend working in the EU Parliament.
